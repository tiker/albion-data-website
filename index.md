# Welcome to the Albion Data Project!

The goal of this project is to collect and distribute realtime information for Albion Online. This is achieved with a 
downloadable client that monitors network traffic specifically for Albion Online, identifies the relevant information, 
and then ships it off to a central server which distributes the information to anyone who wants it.

[Click here to download the client.](https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-client/releases)

<!-- # Contributing
This process is run on a [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com) in order to ensure almost perfect uptime 
and high performance for the users. If you find this project beneficial to you then please consider a donation, thanks!! -->


# Player Information
If you would like to help the Albion Data Project, and all the web sites and applications that use the data provided by 
it, then the best thing you can do is download our client and run it whenever you're playing Albion Online.

The most recent releases can be found here: [https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-client/releases](https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-client/releases)

# Where Can I View The Data I Upload?
> Note that the client can only upload the market orders that you load in game, so be sure to browse the market for the 
prices that you need. When a price is uploaded, it is visible in the data immediately.

## The best way to make use of the data is by using the tools that are built on it:

- [Tools4Albion](https://www.tools4albion.com) provides calculators for crafting, farming, and reprocessing. Has a lot 
of useful information for users and developers alike.
- [AlbionOnline2d](https://www.albiononline2d.com/en/market) pulls the latest information from the database and shows 
different selling metrics for the Auction Houses.
- [Farm Profit Calculator](http://aofarm.skyline969.ca/) utilizes market data to provide a guide to the best farming 
options for you based on current prices.
- [Albion Helper](https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/174675-Beta-Albion-Helper-Discord-Market-Bot-Crafting-Calculator/#post1270471)
 (forked from Albion Assistant) A discord bot to retrieve prices from Albion Online Data Project APIs.

If you have a project you'd like to have listed here, contact a maintainer in discord to talk about it.

## Market data can be also be obtained through the API
### API Enpoints

### API Endpoint Rate Limits

- 180 per 1 minute
- 300 per 5 minutes 

### "I WANT ALL THE DATA FROM THE API"

Well, you can. You just need to do it in a way that doesn't hit the API rate
limit. Combine the item's you want to get data on, as well as locations. 
There's about a 2000 character limit for the url length. You can fit a lot of
items and all the locations in a single call.

Something like [this](https://www.albion-online-data.com/api/v1/stats/prices/T2_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T3_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@4,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@4,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@4,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@2,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@3,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@4,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@1,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@2,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@3,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET1@4,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@4,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@4,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@4,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@2,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@3,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@4,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@1,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@2,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@3,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET2@4,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@4,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@4,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@4,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@2,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@3,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@4,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@1,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@2,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@3,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_SET3@4,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@4,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@4,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@4,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@2,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@3,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@4,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@1,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@2,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@3,T8_SHOES_CLOTH_KEEPER@4,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@1,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@2,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@3,T4_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@4,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@1,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@2,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@3,T5_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@4,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@1,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@2,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@3,T6_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@4,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@1,T7_SHOES_CLOTH_HELL@2?locations=4,7,8,301,1002,1006,1012,1301,2002,2004,2301,3002,3003,3005,3008,3301,4002,4006,4300,4301,5003&qualities=1,2,3,4,5) (too big to show on the page!).

We also ask that if you are going to write a service that continually hits the
API, please use Gzip compression. The server and bandwidth isn't free and while
the monthly bandwidth limit hasn't been exceeded that we're aware of, the 
more people that use the project and it's API, the closer we get to overages.

### Spreadsheets

Many people find it useful to load these APIs in spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. There is no 
single best way to do this, but some of the common ways are as follows:

- [Excel Power Query](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/introduction-to-microsoft-power-query-for-excel-6e92e2f4-2079-4e1f-bad5-89f6269cd605)
- [Google Sheets IMPORTXML](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en)
  - Example: `=IMPORTXML("https://www.albion-online-data.com/api/v2/stats/prices/T4_BAG.xml?locations=Caerleon&qualities=2","//ArrayOfMarketResponse/MarketResponse")`
- [Google Sheets ImportJSON (third-party script)](https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON)
  - Note: Some people have noticed issues with ImportJSON and repeating rows
  - Example: `=ImportJSON("https://www.albion-online-data.com/api/v2/stats/prices/T4_BAG.json?locations=Caerleon&qualities=2", "", "noHeaders")`

## Disable Start With Windows
1. Open up the program `Task Scheduler`.
1. Click on the `Task Scheduler Library` in the left side pane.
1. Find the task with the name `Albion Data Client`.
1. Right-click `Disable` to disable the task.

# Troubleshooting

Starting the client via the command line will allow the error message to persist. 
- Windows
  - Open a run command prompt window with `WIN + r`
  - Enter `"C:\Program Files\Albion Data Client\albiondata-client.exe"`
  - View application output
- MacOS
  - Open a terminal `COMMAND + SPACE` and type `terminal`
  - Enter `/path/to/albiondata-client`
  - View application output
- Linux
  - Open a terminal (too many ways to list, if you use Linux, you should know how)
  - Enter `/path/to/albiondata-client`
  - View application output

## Client crashing
### Device/Adapter Errors

Includes the following Error Messages:
- "No such device exists"
- "Error opening adapter: The system cannot find the device specified. (20)"
- "eth0: You don't have permission to capture on that device (socket: Operation not permitted)" (Linux/MacOS specific)

This means the client can't attach it self to the network interface to capture Albion Online data.

- Windows
  - Open a command prompt
  - Type `ipconfig.exe /all`
  - Look for the network adapter that give's you connectivity and find the `Physical Address` line:![Alt text](images/ipconfig.png)
  - Start the client with the `-l` (lower case L) argument, replacing the physical address of your card: `"C:\Program Files\Albion Data Client\albiondata-client.exe" -l "B4-2E-99-31-90-E2"`
- MacOS
  - Open a terminal
  - Type `ifconfig`
  - Look for the network adapter that give's you connectivity and find the `Physical Address` line:![Alt text](images/macos-ifconfig.png)
  - Start the client with the `-l` (lower case L) argument, replacing the physical address of your card: `/path/to/albiondata-client -l "14:7D:DA:DB:C6:29"`
- Linux (essentially the same as MacOS)
  - Open a terminal
  - Type `ifconfig`
  - Look for the network adapter that give's you connectivity and find the `Physical Address` line:![Alt text](images/linux-ifconfig.png)
  - Start the client with the `-l` (lower case L) argument, replacing the physical address of your card: `/path/to/albiondata-client -l "7E-13-57-B4-C4-3B"`

### MacOS/Linux needs sudo

[Original developer discussing the issue.](https://github.com/regner/albiondata-client/issues/125)

Running the Albion Online Data client with sudo is the easiest way to get going. But, you can work around needing full sudo if you understand Linux/MacOS permssions.

The following has been copied and modified to fit this project's use.

Note: `aod` group is short for "Albion Online Data". You'll need to substitute `/path/to/albiondata-client` with the actual path to your client.

```
Add a capture group and add yourself to it:

Source: https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap/issues/783#issuecomment-1021912001
sudo groupadd aod
sudo usermod -a -G aod $USER

Next, change the group of tcpdump and set permissions:

sudo chgrp aod /path/to/albiondata-client
sudo chmod 750 /path/to/albiondata-client
```

## Client is "HTTP Error while proving pow. returned 902" message

This means your Albion Online Data client is taking too long to send data to our servers. This is slowed down on
purpose because we ask your computer to do some math that our server already as the answer to. We needed to add
this because bad actors/spammers were sending us bad data and this slowed them down. With that, we wanted to make
sure we didn't eat up all CPU cycles on your machine, so we limit it to [25% CPU](https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-client/blob/master/client/uploader_http_pow.go#L32).

If you wish to bypass this and let your entire CPU be consumed while searching Albion Online markets, you can add 
the [-no-limit](https://www.albion-online-data.com/#parameters) parameter when running the Albion Online Data client
manually. But... (read next section)

## Client receives "403 Forbidden" message

This means you have requested POW and/or sent POW result with data very fast recently. The rate limits can be found
[here](https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-gate/blob/main/config.rb#L7). Note, everything is x2 because to send 1
successful chunk of data, your Albion Online Data client must request a POW then submit the POW result + data. So,
for example, per_minute is 270*2, which means you can send 270 chunks of data per minute before being throttled.

# Developer Information
If you're building something to consume the data published by the
Albion Data Project here are some things you will need to know:
- NATS Connection String: nats://public:thenewalbiondata@www.albion-online-data.com:4222
- NATS Topics:
  - `goldprices.deduped`
  - `marketorders.deduped`
  - `mapdata.deduped`
- Structure of data messages: [albiondata-client/lib](https://github.com/ao-data/albiondata-client/tree/master/lib)

A note on duplicate messages. As information comes into the NATS Server it is looked at and deduplicated over a 5 minute
 window. As a subscriber the goal is that you should only get the same message once every 5 minutes. This is of course 
 open for change as we go however. The reason we are sending the same message at all is two fold.

New people connecting to the network may have missed previous messages. Along with that however we don’t have a good way
 of noticing things like market orders completing. To remove market orders from your application the current best idea 
 around is to keep track of the last time an order was seen, and then after not seeing it for X hours remove it has 
 probably having been completed.

## Database Table Exports

You can find daily table dumps on the server at [https://www.albion-online-data.com/database/](https://www.albion-online-data.com/database/). 
The export contains a .sql file for each table, and a .zip file for each table that contains a tab-separated .txt data 
file which can be imported into MySQL using common tools.
